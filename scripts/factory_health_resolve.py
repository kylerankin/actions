factory_health_resolve — decide which factory alert issues have recovered.

``.github/workflows/factory-health.yml`` files one issue per (repo, pipeline)
whose 24h success rate falls below the threshold, and deduplicates new alerts by
matching the open issue titles against the prefix

    fix(factory): [<repo>] [<pipeline>] success rate dropped

Nothing ever closed those issues again, so a single stale alert permanently
muted its pipeline: every later breach of the same repo+pipeline hit the dedupe
branch and was silently dropped (projectbluefin/actions#490 — dakota Promote
recovered to 100% on the rerun and the alert stayed open regardless).

This module maps the health results plus the open issue list onto the issues
that should now be closed: the pipeline is healthy again *and* an alert issue
for it is still open *and* that issue was opened by the account that files the
alerts.  The author check keeps the close pass off issues it did not open: a
human tracking issue, or anyone's issue whose title happens to share the alert
prefix, is left alone.

Usage (from the workflow):
    python3 scripts/factory_health_resolve.py \
        --results results.json \
        --open-issues open-issues.json \
        --author app/mergeraptor

``--results`` is the array produced by the monitor loop (one object per
pipeline, with ``repo``, ``pipeline``, ``workflow``, ``status``, ``rate_display``,
``success`` and ``total``).  ``--open-issues`` is ``gh issue list --json
number,title,url,author`` output.  ``--author`` is the login the alerting token
files issues as, in ``gh issue list`` form (``app/<app-slug>`` for a GitHub App
bot, ``app/github-actions`` for the workflow token).  A JSON array of recovery
records is written to stdout (or to ``--output``), each shaped:

    {
        "number": 490,
        "url": "https://github.com/projectbluefin/actions/issues/490",
        "title": "fix(factory): [projectbluefin/dakota] [Promote] ...",
        "repo": "projectbluefin/dakota",

    Return the open alert issues whose pipeline is healthy again.

    A pipeline qualifies only when its status is ``healthy``.  ``no-runs`` is
    deliberately *not* treated as a recovery: a window with no completed runs is
    an absence of evidence, not evidence the pipeline was fixed, so its alert
    stays open until a real run proves otherwise.

    Only issues opened by ``author`` qualify.  The title prefix alone is not
    proof the workflow opened an issue, and the close pass comments on and
    closes whatever it returns.  An empty ``author`` matches nothing, so a
    missing login fails closed instead of widening the match.

    Every open issue matching the pipeline's title prefix is returned, not just
    the first — duplicates from earlier breaches are equally stale once the
    pipeline is healthy.
