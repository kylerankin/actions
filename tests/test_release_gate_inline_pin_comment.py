"""Regression coverage for in-repo testsuite `e2e.yml` pin drift and
inline-comment drift.

The release-gate inline pin comment is repeated across three workflow files:

* ``.github/workflows/reusable-execute-release.yml`` — release-gate
* ``.github/workflows/migration-test.yml``
* ``.github/workflows/upgrade-test.yml``

`docs/skills/composite-actions/reusable-workflow.md` requires:

  * the same SHA in every caller (so Renovate bumps them together)
  * the same ``# v1`` version comment in every caller
  * the inline release-gate comment must not claim a
    ``projectbluefin/testsuite`` SHA pin that does
    not exist (testsuite manages the floating ``e2e.yml@v1`` tag
    itself, so no SHA pin there is ever to match)

The refs must be full 40-char SHAs so the gate executes a fixed digest.
